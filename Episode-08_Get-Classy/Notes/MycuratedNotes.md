# Episode 08: Get Classy - Class Components in React

## Overview
In this episode, we dive deep into React class components to build a solid foundation for understanding React fundamentals. Class components are frequently featured in technical interviews, making this knowledge essential for developers.

## Key Learning Points

### What are Class Components?
- **Definition**: ES6 classes that extend from `React.Component`
- **Requirement**: Must contain a `render()` method
- **Purpose**: Provide a way to create stateful components with lifecycle methods

### Practical Implementation
We'll build an **About Page** using class components that includes:
- **API Integration**: Fetching data from GitHub API
- **Team Information**: Displaying developer profiles and details
- **Real-world Application**: Creating a functional team showcase page

## Why This Matters
- Foundation for understanding React's evolution
- Essential knowledge for technical interviews
- Understanding legacy codebases
- Comparison point for modern functional components with hooks
